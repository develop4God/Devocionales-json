      "content": "In astronomy, Venus is known as the 'Morning Star.' Unlike distant stars, Venus is close and its brightness is so intense that it's the last thing to disappear when the sun rises.\n\nVenus reaches its maximum splendor during the fourth watch (between 3:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.), the moment when the atmosphere is coldest and the darkness seems densest.\n\nVenus is not the sun, but it is its herald (Eskēnōsen - physical evidence). Its appearance on the horizon is proof that the earth's rotation has conquered the night. If you see Venus, sunrise is mathematically inevitable.",

This prophecy was recorded in the libraries of Mesopotamia.\n\nCenturies later, Daniel was appointed 'Master of the Magicians' in Babylon (Daniel 2:48). He connected the 'Star' of Balaam with the 'Time' of the seventy weeks from his own prophecy.\n\nWhen the Wise Men from the East saw the star over Bethlehem, they weren't following a common planet. They were following a light that moved from north to south and stopped over a house: the Shekinah (Glory of God) guiding the Gentiles toward the incarnate New Shekinah.",

      "content": "Pentecost was not chosen at random. It was one of the three most important pilgrimage feasts in Israel.\n\n📅 THE NAME 'PENTECOST':\n\n• From Greek 'Pentēkostē' = fiftieth\n• Celebrated 50 days after Passover\n• Also called 'Feast of Weeks' (Shavuot in Hebrew)\n• Or 'Feast of Firstfruits' or 'Feast of Harvest'\n\n🌾 THE AGRICULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE:\n\n• Marked the end of the barley harvest (which began at Passover)\n• And the beginning of the wheat harvest\n• It was time to present the FIRSTFRUITS of the harvest to God\n• Time of thanksgiving for divine provision\n\n👥 THE INTERNATIONAL CROWD:\n\nActs 2:5 says: 'And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven'.\n\nPentecost attracted diaspora Jews from ALL over the known world:\n• Parthians, Medes, Elamites (Persia/Iran)\n• Mesopotamia (Iraq)\n• Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia (Turkey)\n• Phrygia, Pamphylia (Greece/Asia Minor)\n• Egypt, Libya\n• Rome\n• Crete and Arabians\n\n🎯 GOD'S SOVEREIGNTY:\n\nGod didn't send the Spirit on just any day. He sent it:\n• On the feast of FIRSTFRUITS - the 3,000 converted that day are the firstfruits of the worldwide harvest\n• When Jerusalem was full of Jews from ALL nations - so the gospel would spread immediately\n• 50 days after Passover - the Lamb had been sacrificed; now comes the Power to proclaim Him",

      "content": "Acts 2:4 says: 'They were all FILLED with the Holy Ghost'.\n\n🔑 THE GREEK WORD PLĒRŌŌ (plēthō in aorist passive):\n\n• Means to fill completely, saturate, fill to the brim\n• Not 'a little' of the Spirit\n• Not 'a portion' of the Spirit\n• COMPLETE FULLNESS - like a cup filled to overflowing\n\n📊 'WERE FILLED' (Eplēsthēsan):\n\nIt's PASSIVE voice:\n• They didn't fill themselves\n• They WERE filled by God\n• It's something they RECEIVED, not something they PRODUCED\n\nIt's AORIST tense:\n• Punctual, definite action\n• Occurred at a specific moment\n• It wasn't gradual; it was sudden\n\n🌬️ THE PHYSICAL SIGNS:\n\nBefore the filling, there were three supernatural signs:\n\n1️⃣ 'A sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind' (v.2)\n• Ruach (Hebrew) = wind/spirit\n• Pneuma (Greek) = wind/spirit\n• The same symbolism Jesus used with Nicodemus (John 3:8)\n\n2️⃣ 'Cloven tongues like as of fire' (v.3)\n• Fire = God's presence (burning bush, pillar of fire)\n• 'Cloven' = distributed, each one received\n• 'Like as of fire' = not literal fire, but appeared as fire\n\n3️⃣ 'It sat upon each of them' (v.3)\n• The Spirit no longer comes only upon prophets, kings and priests\n• Now He comes upon ALL - men, women, young, old\n\n✨ THE CONTRAST WITH THE OLD TESTAMENT:\n\n• Before: the Spirit came UPON some (prophets, kings)\n• Now: the Spirit comes WITHIN all (new creation)\n• Before: temporary and selective\n• Now: permanent and universal (for every believer)",

It was born as a GLOBAL movement from day one.\n\n📖 FULFILLMENT OF JOEL 2:28-29:\n\nPeter quotes this prophecy: 'I will pour out of my Spirit upon ALL FLESH... your sons and your daughters shall prophesy... on my servants and on my handmaidens'.\n\nThere is no restriction of:\n• Age (young and old)\n• Gender (sons and daughters)\n• Social class (servants and handmaidens)\n• Ethnicity (all flesh)",

Use me as you used Peter - not by my ability, but by your filling. In the name of Jesus, Amen."

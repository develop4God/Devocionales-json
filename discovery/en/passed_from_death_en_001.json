He raised them because their salvation was already SEALED. If they could be lost, God wouldn't have invested His resurrection power in them.'\n\n✨ THE CONNECTION:\n\nIf PHYSICAL RESURRECTION is irreversible...\nWon't SPIRITUAL RESURRECTION also be?\n\n📖 JOHN 5:24:\n\n'Whoever hears my word...

Like the saints who came out of their tombs in Matthew 27, I came out of my 'spiritual tomb' when You gave me life. And just as You didn't raise them to lose them, You didn't save me to lose me. Forgive my unbelief when I live in fear of 'losing' what You already sealed with the Holy Spirit. Help me to obey not from fear of condemnation, but from gratitude for adoption. I'm not an employee on probation. I'm a SON with a guaranteed inheritance. I cannot be 'un-born.' Thank You for Your unbreakable faithfulness. In Jesus' name, Amen."

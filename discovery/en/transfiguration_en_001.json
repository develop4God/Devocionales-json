Peter, James, and John SEE the Son of Man in His glory - a preview of His kingdom.\n\n⛰️ THE MOUNT (likely Mount Hermon):\n\n• Height: 9,232 feet - the highest mountain in Israel\n• Covered with snow at its summit ('white as the light')\n• Remote location, far from crowds\n• Border between Israel and the gentile world\n\n📖 THE BIBLICAL PATTERN:\n\nGod reveals Himself on mountains:\n• Moses receives the Law on Sinai\n• Elijah hears the still small voice on Horeb\n• Jesus gives the Sermon on the Mount\n• Jesus prays on the Mount of Olives\n• Jesus dies on Golgotha (mount)\n• Jesus ascends from the Mount of Olives\n\nMountains are places of divine encounter, where heaven touches earth.",

He let His INTERNAL glory shine through His humanity.\n\nFor 33 years, Jesus had VEILED His glory.

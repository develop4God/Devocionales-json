      "content": "Jesus summons the eleven disciples to a mountain in Galilee (Matthew 28:16). This was not accidental. Mountains in Jesus' ministry were always places of revelation:\n\n🏔️ SIGNIFICANT MOUNTAINS IN MATTHEW:\n\n• Mount of Beatitudes - Where Jesus taught the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7)\n• Mount of Transfiguration - Where He was glorified before Peter, James and John (Matthew 17)\n• Mount of Olives - Where He prophesied about the end times (Matthew 24)\n• Mount Calvary - Where He was crucified\n• THIS mountain in Galilee - Where He commissions His disciples\n\n🔍 THE CONTRAST:\n\nGalilee was despised by Jerusalem's religious elite. It was considered provincial, the land of the Gentiles. But Jesus CHOOSES Galilee:\n\n• There He began His ministry (Matthew 4:12-17)\n• There He called His first disciples (Matthew 4:18-22)\n• From there He now sends them to the world\n\nFrom the despised place, God launches the movement that will change the world.\n\n✨ THE ANGEL'S PROMISE:\n\nIn Matthew 28:7, the angel had told them: 'Go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him'.\n\nThe risen Jesus did NOT stay in Jerusalem (the religious center). He returned to Galilee (where it all began) to close one circle and open a new one.",

      "content": "After singing the Hallel (Psalms 113-118) at the Last Supper, Jesus and his disciples went out to a place called Gethsemane (Mark 14:26, 32).\n\n🫒 THE MEANING OF THE NAME:\n\n'Gethsemane' comes from the Hebrew 'Gath-Shemanim':\n• Gath = Press\n• Shemanim = Oils\n\nIt literally means: 'The oil press'\n\n⚙️ HOW AN OLIVE PRESS WORKED:\n\n1. Olives were placed under a massive stone\n2. The stone pressed with crushing weight\n3. Only under extreme pressure did the pure oil flow\n4. That oil illuminated the Temple (Exodus 27:20)\n\n✨ THE PROPHETIC SYMBOLISM:\n\nJesus, like the olive, would be 'pressed' under the weight of:\n• All the sins of humanity\n• God's wrath against evil\n• Separation from the Father\n\nAnd from that pressure would flow the 'oil' of the Holy Spirit that would illuminate the world.\n\n🎵 WHAT HE HAD JUST SUNG:\n\nIn the Hallel, Jesus sang Psalm 118:22: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.'\n\nHe sang about his own rejection before entering the place of crushing.",

Not ordinary fear; it's a dread that leaves one paralyzed, a horror beyond comprehension.\n\n🌊 SECOND WORD: ADĒMONEIN (Strong G85)\n\n• A = Without\n• Demos = Home/Place\n\nLiteral meaning: 'To be homeless', to feel utterly alienated, disoriented, out of place. It's the sensation of not belonging anywhere.\n\n💔 THE DEPTH:\n\nJesus experienced:\n• Supernatural terror at the cup of wrath\n• Absolute desolation at the coming separation\n• Anguish beyond human endurance\n\n🩸 LUKE ADDS (22:44):\n\n'And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.'\n\nHEMATIDROSIS: A medical condition where under extreme stress, the capillaries surrounding the sweat glands rupture and blood mixes with sweat.",

(Strong G5)\n\nAbba was the word Jewish children used to call their father:\n• Equivalent to 'Daddy' or 'Papa'\n• One of the first words they learned to say\n• Implies complete trust and total dependence\n\n⚠️ THE SCANDAL:\n\nFor the religious leaders, calling God 'Abba' was almost irreverent. God was:\n• The Most High\n• The Unnameable (YHWH)\n• The Thrice Holy\n\nBut Jesus breaks that barrier in his moment of greatest need.\n\n💡 THE PARADOX OF GETHSEMANE:\n\nJesus is experiencing:\n• Ekthambeisthai (astonished terror) - adult feeling of dread\n• Adēmonein (homeless desolation) - existential anguish\n\nAnd in that moment, he resorts to the language of his childhood: 'Daddy...'\n\n✨ WHAT THIS TEACHES US:\n\nWhen the world crumbles and pain is unbearable, Jesus' deepest identity (and ours through the New Covenant) is that of being a SON.\n\n🎁 YOUR INHERITANCE TODAY:\n\nRomans 8:15 - 'The Spirit you received does not make you slaves, so that you live in fear again; rather, the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship.

Not once, but THREE times.\n\n😔 THE REBUKE TO PETER (v. 37):\n\nJesus doesn't call him 'Peter' (the rock), but 'SIMON' - his old name.\n\nIt's like saying: 'You're acting like the old man, not the rock I said you would be.'\n\n⚔️ THE KEY LESSON (v. 38):\n\n'The spirit (pneuma) is willing (prothymon), but the flesh (sarx) is weak (asthenēs).'\n\n• PROTHYMON (Strong G4289) = Ready, eager, willing\n• ASTHENĒS (Strong G772) = Without strength, incapable, sick\n\nPeter WANTED to help. His heart was sincere. But his human nature didn't have the necessary fuel.\n\n🙏 THE MISSING BRIDGE: PRAYER\n\nPrayer is what transfers the strength of God's Spirit to overcome the weakness of our flesh.\n\nJesus demonstrated this:\n• His sarx didn't want the cup\n• But through prayer, his pneuma took control\n\nThe disciples, by not praying, let their sarx (sleep) dominate their pneuma (love for Jesus).\n\n🔄 THE PARALLELISM OF THREE:\n\n• Three times they slept\n• Three times Peter would deny him\n• Three times Jesus would restore him (John 21)\n\nPeter's fall didn't begin in the courtyard with the denial. It began in Gethsemane with sleep.",

      "subtitle": "Why John chose this specific word",
      "content": "When John writes 'In the beginning was the LOGOS', he's using a word loaded with meaning for both Jews and Greeks.\n\n🏛️ FOR GREEK PHILOSOPHERS:\n\n• Stoics used 'Logos' to describe the rational principle governing the universe\n• Heraclitus (~500 BC) taught that Logos was the ordering force of the cosmos\n• Plato saw it as the bridge between the ideal and material world\n• For them, Logos was an IDEA, a CONCEPT, an IMPERSONAL FORCE\n\n📜 FOR THE JEWS:\n\n• 'Logos' translates Hebrew 'Dabar' - God's creative Word\n• In Genesis 1, God SPEAKS and creation obeys: 'And God said, Let there be light: and there was light'\n• Psalm 33:6 declares: 'By the word of the LORD were the heavens made'\n• God's Word does NOT return void (Isaiah 55:11)\n\n💥 WHAT JOHN DOES:\n\nJohn takes this familiar word and INCARNATES it. He declares something scandalous: 'That Logos you debate philosophically, that Dabar who created the universe - HE BECAME FLESH! He has a name! He is Jesus of Nazareth!'",

      "subtitle": "Each phrase destroys a different heresy",
      "content": "John 1:1 contains THREE statements that together form a complete defense of Christ's divinity:\n\n1️⃣ 'IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD' (Ēn archē ēn ho Logos)\n\n• 'Was' (ēn) = imperfect tense in Greek = continuous existence without beginning\n• Does NOT say 'came to be' or 'was created'\n• Destroys the heresy: 'Christ was the first created being'\n• TRUTH: Christ existed BEFORE the beginning. He is eternal.\n\n2️⃣ 'AND THE WORD WAS WITH GOD' (kai ho Logos ēn pros ton Theon)\n\n• 'Pros' = face to face, in constant intimate relationship\n• Not just 'beside' - it's active communion\n• Destroys the heresy: 'Jesus is just another name for God the Father (modalism)'\n• TRUTH: The Logos is a DISTINCT Person in relationship with the Father.\n\n3️⃣ 'AND THE WORD WAS GOD' (kai Theos ēn ho Logos)\n\n• Does NOT say 'a god' (Arian heresy)\n• Theos without article emphasizes divine NATURE\n• Destroys the heresy: 'Jesus is just a prophet or angel'\n• TRUTH: The Logos shares the SAME divine nature as the Father.\n\n✨ SUMMARY:\nJesus is eternally God (verse 1a), distinct in person from the Father (verse 1b), but identical in divine nature (verse 1c).",

      "subtitle": "John 1:3 - Christ's divine authorship",
      "content": "John 1:3 declares: 'All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.'\n\n🔗 THE GENESIS CONNECTION:\n\nJohn opens his gospel with the SAME words Moses opened the Bible: 'In the beginning'. This is no coincidence. John is saying: 'The one who spoke in Genesis 1 and created the universe is the same one now walking through Galilee'.\n\nGenesis 1:\n• 'And God said, Let there be light' → The Word (Logos) SPEAKS\n• 'And there was light' → Creation OBEYS\n• 10 times it says 'And God said' → 10 creative acts by the Word\n\nJohn 1:\n• 'All things were made by him' → Jesus is the Creative Agent\n• 'Without him was not ANY THING made that was made' → Absolute emphasis\n\n📊 THE TRIPLE STRUCTURE:\n\nJohn uses three phrases to eliminate all doubt:\n1. 'All things' (panta) = EVERYTHING without exception\n2. 'Were made by him' (di autou egeneto) = He is the Agent\n3. 'Without him NOTHING... was made' = Negative statement for reinforcement\n\n💡 DEVASTATING IMPLICATION:\n\nIf Christ created ALL things, then:\n• Angels were created by Him (including Satan)\n• Time was created by Him (He transcends time)\n• Matter was created by Him (He's not limited by physical laws)\n• YOU were created by Him (He designed you with purpose)",

      "content": "John continues: 'In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.'\n\n🔦 LIFE = LIGHT:\n\nJohn connects two concepts:\n• Life (zoē) = not biological life (bios), but ETERNAL life, God's life\n• Light (phōs) = revelation, truth, God's presence\n\nWhere Christ is, there is LIFE. And where there is life, there's LIGHT that exposes darkness.\n\n⚔️ THE CONFLICT:\n\n'The darkness comprehended it not' - the Greek verb (katelaben) has double meaning:\n1. 'Comprehend' - darkness did NOT UNDERSTAND the light\n2. 'Overcome' - darkness could NOT EXTINGUISH the light\n\nBoth meanings are intentional. Darkness:\n• Cannot comprehend light (they're incompatible)\n• Cannot extinguish light (it's powerless)\n\n🌍 HISTORICAL APPLICATION:\n\n• Herod tried to kill baby Jesus → FAILED\n• Pharisees tried to trap Him in His words → FAILED\n• Romans tried to execute Him → He rose on the third day\n• Satan tried to destroy the church for 2,000 years → STILL HERE\n\nLight ALWAYS overcomes darkness. There's no real battle; only exposure.",

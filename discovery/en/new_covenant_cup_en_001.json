Identifying the heirs (His disciples)\n2. Presenting the testament (The bread and the cup)\n3. Announcing His death (Necessary to validate the testament)\n\n📜 THE LANGUAGE OF HEBREWS 9:15-17:\n\n'Christ is the mediator of a NEW COVENANT... In the case of a WILL, it is necessary to prove the death of the one who made it, because a will is in force only when somebody has died.'\n\n🔑 THE KEY WORD: DIATHĒKĒ (Strong G1242)\n\nIn Greek, diathēkē means TWO things:\n• COVENANT - A solemn agreement\n• WILL/TESTAMENT - Someone's last testament\n\nJesus uses both meanings simultaneously.\n\n💰 HOW A WILL WORKS:\n\n• The testator (who makes the will) disposes of their property\n• The heirs (beneficiaries) are named\n• The will has NO validity while the testator lives\n• Only the DEATH of the testator activates the inheritance\n\n✨ AT THE SUPPER:\n\nJesus is the TESTATOR who:\n• Disposes of His life, His forgiveness, His Spirit\n• Names heirs (all who believe)\n• Announces He must die for them to inherit\n• Signs with His blood",

The debate centers on ESTIN (Strong G1510).\n\n📖 INTERPRETATIONS:\n\n1️⃣ LITERAL POSITION:\n• If Jesus meant 'represents,' there were other words\n• The Greek estin denotes real identity\n• Christ's word 'does' what it says\n\n2️⃣ SYMBOLIC POSITION:\n• Greek (like Aramaic) uses 'to be' metaphorically\n• Like 'I am the door' or 'I am the vine'\n• It is a memorial (anamnesis)\n\n🔑 WHAT THE GREEK REVEALS:\n\nFour verbs in sequence (v. 22):\n\n1. LAMBANŌ (G2983) - TOOK: Receive with sovereign intention\n2. EULOGEŌ (G2127) - BLESSED: 'Speak a good word,' infuse with divine purpose\n3. KLAŌ (G2806) - BROKE: Break to distribute (only used for bread in NT)\n4. DIDŌMI (G1325) - GAVE: Deliver as a gift\n\n🍞 THE WORD 'BODY': SŌMA (G4983)\n\nJesus does NOT use SARX (physical flesh, muscles).\nHe uses SŌMA (the complete person, the integral being).\n\nHe doesn't say: 'This is my dead flesh.'\nHe says: 'This is my SŌMA,' my total presence, my complete self.\n\n🔄 THE RHYTHM OF CHRISTIAN LIFE:\n\n• We are TAKEN by God (we don't choose ourselves)\n• BLESSED by His grace (declared good)\n• BROKEN in our pride (to distribute)\n• GIVEN to the world for service (not to accumulate)",

      "content": "Mark 14:24 - 'This is my blood of the NEW COVENANT (diathēkē kainē), which is poured out for many.'\n\n🔗 THE PROPHECY OF JEREMIAH 31:31:\n\n'The days are coming... when I will make a NEW COVENANT... It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors... I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts.'\n\n🆕 THE WORD 'NEW': KAINOS (G2537)\n\nThere are TWO words for 'new' in Greek:\n• NEOS = New in time (something young, recent)\n• KAINOS = New in quality (something unprecedented)\n\nJesus uses KAINOS. It's not just a 'newer' covenant. It's a covenant of entirely DIFFERENT nature.\n\n📊 COVENANT COMPARISON:\n\nOLD COVENANT (Moses):\n✓ Written on stone (external)\n✓ 'If you obey, you will live' (conditional)\n✓ Blood of animals (temporary)\n✓ Covered sin (kippur)\n✓ Had to be repeated\n\nNEW COVENANT (Jesus):\n✓ Written on the heart (internal)\n✓ 'It is finished' (unconditional)\n✓ Blood of Christ (eternal)\n✓ Removes sin (apolytrōsis)\n✓ Once for all\n\n🩸 'POURED OUT': EKCHYNNŌ (G1632)\n\nIt's not a drip. It's a total EMPTYING.\n\nUsed for:\n• The pouring out of bowls of wrath (Revelation)\n• The pouring out of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2)\n\nIt's a verb of extreme abundance. Jesus 'empties' (kenōsis) Himself completely.\n\n⚖️ THE LEGAL MECHANISM (Hebrews 9:15):\n\n'Christ is the mediator... now that he has DIED as a ransom to SET THEM FREE from the sins committed under the FIRST COVENANT.'\n\n• APOLYTRŌSIS (G629) = Redemption, payment for a slave's liberation\n• The Law exposed sin but couldn't break the chains\n• Christ's death functions as the final payment that 'purchases' our freedom",

      "content": "Hebrews 9:22 - 'Without the shedding of blood there is NO forgiveness (aphesis).'\n\n🩸 WHY BLOOD?\n\nIn biblical thought, blood is the symbol of LIFE (Leviticus 17:11).\n\n'The life of a creature is in the blood... it is the blood that makes atonement for one's life.'\n\n⚖️ THE LEGAL PRINCIPLE:\n\nTo 'seal' a covenant of life and death:\n• Someone has to die (the wages of sin is death)\n• Blood represents the life given\n• No death = no payment = no forgiveness\n\n🐑 OLD COVENANT:\n\n• An animal died IN PLACE of the person\n• It was TEMPORARY substitution\n• Had to be repeated each year\n• The blood 'covered' (kippur) but didn't 'remove' sin\n\n✝️ NEW COVENANT:\n\n• The Testator Himself dies FOR the heirs\n• It is ETERNAL substitution\n• Once for all (ephapax)\n• The blood 'removes' (airō) sin completely\n\n🔑 THE KEY DIFFERENCE:\n\nHebrews 10:4 - 'It is IMPOSSIBLE for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.'\n\nWhy? Because:\n• An animal doesn't have equivalent value to a human\n• A sinner cannot die for another sinner\n• Only a perfect and voluntary Substitute could pay\n\n✨ JESUS IS THE ONLY QUALIFIED:\n\n• Without sin (2 Corinthians 5:21)\n• God and man (infinite value)\n• Voluntary (John 10:18 - 'No one takes it from me')\n\n🎁 THE RESULT TODAY:\n\nWhen God looks at you, He doesn't see your failures. He sees Christ's blood covering you. The payment has already been made. The testament is validated. The inheritance is yours.",

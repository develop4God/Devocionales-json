      "content": "Palm Sunday, AD 30. Jesus enters Jerusalem five days before His crucifixion. The multitudes cry 'Hosanna!' - but what does it really mean?\n\n📢 THE CRY OF 'HOSANNA':\n\nThe word comes from Hebrew 'Hoshana' (הוֹשִׁיעָ נָּא):\n• 'Hosha' = save\n• 'Na' = please, we beseech thee\n• Literal meaning: 'Save us now!' or 'We beseech thee, save!'\n\nIt was a cry from Psalm 118:25 sung during the Feast of Tabernacles:\n'Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.'\n\n👑 WHAT THE CROWD EXPECTED:\n\n• A POLITICAL Messiah to free them from Rome\n• A MILITARY king to establish David's kingdom\n• A leader to restore Israel's glory\n\nThey shouted 'Hosanna to the Son of David!' expecting Jesus to:\n• March to Pilate's palace\n• Expel the Romans\n• Sit on David's throne\n\n💔 THE DEVASTATING IRONY:\n\nFive days later, the SAME crowd will shout: 'Crucify him!'\n\nWhy? Because Jesus didn't meet their political expectations. He came to save, but not in the way they wanted.\n\nHis kingdom is NOT of this world (John 18:36).",

      "content": "Jesus sends two disciples with specific instructions: 'Go into the village... ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto me' (Matthew 21:2).\n\n🐴 DONKEY VS. HORSE:\n\nIn the ancient world, the animal mattered:\n\n• HORSE = symbol of WAR (conquering kings rode horses)\n• DONKEY/COLT = symbol of PEACE (kings entered in peace riding donkeys)\n\n📜 PROPHETIC FULFILLMENT:\n\nMatthew 21:4-5 directly quotes Zechariah 9:9:\n\n'Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.'\n\nDetails of fulfillment:\n1. 'Thy KING cometh' → Jesus is King\n2. 'Meek' (Greek: praus) → Humble, not proud\n3. 'Upon an ass... a colt' → Exactly as Zechariah prophesied\n\n🎯 THE INTENTIONAL CONTRAST:\n\nJesus deliberately fulfills the prophecy EXACTLY:\n• NOT in a royal chariot\n• NOT on a warhorse\n• NOT with an army behind Him\n• YES on a borrowed colt, symbol of peace and humility\n\n💡 THE MESSAGE:\n\nJesus is declaring:\n'I am the King Zechariah prophesied, but My kingdom is not established by the sword. I come in peace, to conquer hearts, not territories.'",

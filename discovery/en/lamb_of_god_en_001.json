John the Baptist, Israel's most famous prophet, points to an unknown carpenter and says: 'Behold the Lamb of God.'\n\nFor the Jewish audience, this phrase activated 1,500 years of collective memory:\n\n• Every morning and evening, lambs were sacrificed at the Temple in Jerusalem (Exodus 29:38-39). Two daily lambs × 365 days × 1,500 years = over 1 million lambs.\n\n• At every Passover, each Jewish family sacrificed their own lamb. The blood on the doorposts was what saved Israel from death in Egypt.\n\n• On the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur), the high priest entered the Holy of Holies with lamb's blood to atone for the sins of the entire nation.\n\nWhen John says 'the Lamb of God,' he's not using a pretty metaphor. He's declaring: 'This is the Final Lamb. The One all the other lambs were pointing toward.'",

It says AIRŌN - lifts, bears, and CARRIES AWAY.\n\nIt's the same word used when the disciples 'took up' the baskets of leftover bread, or when soldiers 'took up' the cross to carry it.\n\nJesus doesn't put a sheet over your sin so God won't see it. He lifts it from your shoulders, bears it upon His own, walks with it to Golgotha, and buries it in His tomb. When He rises, your sin doesn't rise with Him. IT'S GONE.",

He used AMNOS - the perfect one-year-old lamb, without blemish, the one used in the most sacred sacrifices.\n\nThis word connects directly with Isaiah 53:7: 'He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter.' No coincidence. John is declaring: 'This is the Suffering Servant Isaiah saw 700 years ago.'",

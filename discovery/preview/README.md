# Discovery Preview - Spanish Studies

This folder contains markdown (`.md`) previews of the Spanish Bible studies for easy content review before using them in the app.

## Purpose

The markdown files allow you to:
- **Preview content** in a readable format without opening JSON files
- **Review studies** before publishing to the app
- **Share content** with team members for feedback
- **Check formatting** and ensure quality

## File Format

Each markdown file corresponds to a JSON study file:
- `great_commission_es_001.md` → `../es/great_commission_es_001.json`
- `pentecost_power_es_001.md` → `../es/pentecost_power_es_001.json`
- `damascus_road_es_001.md` → `../es/damascus_road_es_001.json`

## Structure

Each preview includes:
- 📋 Study metadata (title, subtitle, language, version, reading time)
- 📖 Key verse
- 🎴 All 5 cards with full content
- 🏷️ Tags and themes
- 🙏 Discovery questions and prayers
- 📊 Statistics and metadata

## Usage

1. Open any `.md` file in a markdown viewer or text editor
2. Review the content structure and quality
3. Make any needed adjustments in the corresponding JSON file
4. The markdown is for preview only - JSON files are the source of truth

## Note

This folder currently contains **Spanish previews only**. English and other language previews can be added following the same format if needed.
